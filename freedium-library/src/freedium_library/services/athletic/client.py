"""The Athletic article client.

The Athletic's paywall is soft: the full article ships inside the page's
__NEXT_DATA__ payload and is only hidden by a JS overlay, so a plain fetch
(which runs no JS) gets everything. No auth, no API key.

The app's GraphQL API is deliberately not used — its body field is gated
server-side by the JWT's subscription status, and the metadata op that would
only resolve an id → permalink needs a captured token. Since Freedium is
always given a full URL, the web page alone is sufficient.
