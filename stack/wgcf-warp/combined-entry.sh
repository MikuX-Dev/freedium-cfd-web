# Combined wgcf + microsocks entrypoint.
#
# The upstream neilpang/wgcf-docker entry.sh brings Cloudflare Warp up via
# wg-quick and then `sleep infinity`s. We start it in the background, wait
# for the `wgcf` wireguard interface to appear and start routing traffic
# through Cloudflare, then exec microsocks (SOCKS5) in the foreground so
# the container's main process is the proxy and `docker stop` is clean.
#
# microsocks doesn't have a "-b <interface>" option like dante's
# `external: wgcf`. Instead we read the wgcf interface's IPv4 address and
# pass it via `-b <ip>` so microsocks binds outbound connections to that
# source IP — forcing traffic out through the WireGuard tunnel.
